# brokken
 Creating a broken brutalist font. You can find the current state as a usable `OTF`in the `otf`folder. The font is developed in Glyphs 3.

 ## Status Quo
 The font is in very early pre-alpha state. Use at your own risk. I aim to support full Western Latin (including all diacritics and umlauts) but at the moment I focus on central Europe's letter bindings.
